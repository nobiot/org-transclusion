/* makeinfo convert @deffn and similar functions to something inside
   <blockquote>.  style.css uses italic for blockquote.  This looks poor
   in the Emacs manuals, which make extensive use of @defun (etc).
   In particular, references to function arguments appear as <var>
   inside <blockquote>.  Since <var> is also italic, it makes it
   impossible to distinguish variables.  We could change <var> to
   e.g. bold-italic, or normal, or a different color, but that does
   not look as good IMO.  So we just override blockquote to be non-italic.
