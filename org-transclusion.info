Org-transclusion User Manual
****************************


   This manual is for Org-transclusion 1.0.x.

   Last updated 24 December 2021.

   Org-transclusion lets you insert a copy of text content via a file
link or ID link within an Org file.  It lets you have the same content
present in different buffers at the same time without copy-and-pasting
it.  Edit the source of the content, and you can refresh the transcluded
copies to the up-to-date state.  Org-transclusion keeps your files clear
of the transcluded copies, leaving only the links to the original
content.

1 Example Use Cases & Main Features
***********************************

Here are a summary of some real use cases that users have shared with
the author, including his own.

Book writing
     You have a collection of notes.  You can quickly transclude
     paragraphs and sections from your notes and put together a draft.
     As transclusions are links, it’s easy to re-organize them into
     different sequences to see which way works the best.

Academic writing
     You have a collection of quotes and notes from your research and
     literature review.  Transclude relevant elements of quotes and
     notes into different papers.  You can keep your collection as the
     central repository of your research.

Technical writing
     You write technical documents for software.  Transclude relevant
     lines of code into the document.  As the code is only transcluded,
     you can keep the document up-to-date as the code evolves.

Project status reports
     You work on multiple projects at the same time and need to report
     to different project managers.  Transclude relevant parts of your
     work notes and logs into respective project reports.  You can keep
     a single collection of your work notes and logs.

   Main Features:

   • Insert a copy of text content via a file link or ID link into an
     Org file

   • Work with any text file such as program source cod, plain text,
     Markdown, or other Org files

   • Keep the file system clear of the copies of text content –
     Org-transclusion tries hard to save only the links to the file
     system

   • For Org files, use different headline levels from the source Org
     file

   • For Org files, use filters to include only relevant elements (e.g.
     filter out properties in the transclusions)

   • For program source and plain text files, transclude a certain lines
     or dynamically specify the from/to lines to keep the transclusion
     always up-to-date with the evolving source files

   • For program source files, transclude parts or whole code directly
     into Org’s source block to leverage the rich Org features

   • Extend Org-transclusion with its extension framework

2 Installation
**************

This package is available on GNU ELPA
(https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/org-transclusion.html).  You can do ‘M-x
package-install RET org-transclusion’ to install it.  After
installation, you can start using Org-transclusion (refer to the *note
Getting Started:: section).

   Below are some example keybindings that can be put into your Emacs
configuration.

     (define-key global-map (kbd "<f12>") #'org-transclusion-add)
     (define-key global-map (kbd "C-n t") #'org-transclusion-mode)

   For Doom users, you would need to do something like this below to
install the package and configure the keybindings.

     ;; ~/.doom.d/package.el
     (package! org-transclusion)


     ;; ~/.doom.d/config.el
     (use-package! org-transclusion
       :after org
       :init
       (map!
        :map global-map "<f12>" #'org-transclusion-add
        :leader
        :prefix "n"
        :desc "Org Transclusion Mode" "t" #'org-transclusion-mode))

3 Getting Started
*****************

The basic idea of Org-transclusion is simple: insert a copy of text
content via a file link or ID link within an Org file.  This is an Org
Mode version of transclusion.

   To transclude content via a link, use one of the following commands:

   • ‘org-transclusion-add’

   • ‘org-transclusion-add-all’

   • ‘org-transclusion-make-from-link’

   For example, if you have an ID link in your Org file like this:

     [[id:20210501T171427.051019][Bertrand Russell]]

   Simply type to add ‘#+transclude:’ in front of the link like the
example below.

     #+transclude: [[id:20210501T171427.051019][Bertrand Russell]]

   Put your cursor somewhere on this keyword line and type ‘M-x
org-transclusion-add RET’, and you will see the text content that the ID
points to replace the whole line.  If you have multiple links with a
transclude keyword, you can type ‘M-x org-transclusion-add-all RET’ to
add all transclusions in the current buffer.

   Alternatively, you can also put cursor somewhere on the link and type
‘M-x org-transclusion-make-from-link RET’.  That will insert another
line with ‘#+transclusion:’ keyword added in front of a copy of the
original link in the next empty line.

   The transcluded text is *read-only* but you can copy it and export it
as normal text.  Org-transclusion remembers where it has transcluded the
text from (its source buffer).  You can call a number of useful commands
with a single letter (by default).

   For example, you can press ‘o’ to open the source buffer of the
transclusion at point, or ‘O’ (capital "o") to open and move to it.
Press ‘g’ to refresh the transclusion.  Press ‘e’ to start live-sync
edit.  For more detail, inspect the documentation of each command.
Press ‘d’ to remove the transcluded content, putting the original
‘#+transclude: [[id:id-of-the-content]]’.

   This single-letter-context-menu is defined in ‘org-transclusion-map’.
The default keybindings are shown below.  Adapt them to your liking,
especially if you use Vim keybindings with Evil Mode, etc.

     key             binding
     ---             -------

     C-c             Prefix Command
     TAB             org-cycle
     D               org-transclusion-demote-subtree
     O               org-transclusion-move-to-source
     P               org-transclusion-promote-subtree
     d               org-transclusion-remove
     e               org-transclusion-live-sync-start
     g               org-transclusion-refresh
     o               org-transclusion-open-source

     C-c C-c         org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c


   This should get you started with Org-transclusion.  There are more
options and customizing options available for you to fine-tune the text
content you transclude.  Explore the rest of the user manual and play
with Org-transclusion to get familiar with it.

4.1 Org-transclusion mode, activate, and deactivate
===================================================

Org-transclusion is a local minor mode; however, you do not need to
explicitly call ‘org-transclusion-mode’.  The minor mode is intended to
be just a convenient wrapper to let you easily toggle between ‘activate’
and ‘deactivate’.

   As you saw in the *note Getting Started section: Getting Started.
above, calling ‘org-transclusion-add’ or ‘org-transclusion-add-all’ is
enough to add transclusions in your current buffer.

   The minor mode is automatically turned on locally for your current
buffer through one of these commands.  All it does is to call
‘org-transclusion-activate’ to activate hooks and some other variables.
Their main purpose is to keep files in the filesystem clear of the
transcluded content.

   Turn off the minor mode or use ‘org-transclusion-deactivate’; you
will remove all the transclusions in the current buffer and clear the
hooks and other setup variables.

   If you prefer, you can use ‘org-transclusion-mode’ as your entry
command for transclusion.  When customizable variable
‘org-transclusion-add-all-on-activate’ is non-nil (it is ‘t’ by
default), turning on the minor mode calls the ‘org-transclusion-add-all’
command to attempt to add all transclusions automatically in the current
buffer.

   You can control whether or not transclusions are to be added
automatically per transclude keyword.  By default,
‘org-transclusion-add-all’ (it is also used by ‘org-transclusion-mode’)
will work on every transclude keyword in the buffer.  Add
‘:disable-auto’ property to a keyword as shown in the example below;
‘add-all’ skips transclude keywords with it.

     #+transclude: [[file:path/to/file.org]] :disable-auto

   You can override the ‘:disable-auto’ property by manually calling
‘org-transclusion-add’ at point.

4.2 Org links supported
=======================

Transclusion has been tested to work for the following types of links:

   • File link for an entire org file/buffer; e.g.
     ‘[[file:~/org/file.org][My Org Notes]]’
   • File link with ‘::*heading’
   • File link with ‘::#custom-id’
   • File link with ‘::name’ for blocks (e.g.  blocked quotations),
     tables, and links
   • File link with ‘::dedicated-target’; this is intended for linking
     to a paragraph.  See below.
   • ID link ‘id:uuid’
   • File link for non-org files (tested with ‘.txt’ and ‘.md’); for
     these, the whole buffer gets transcluded

     Note: Search-options ‘::/regex/’ and ‘::number’ do not work as
     intended.

   For transcluding a specific paragraph, there are two main ways: Org
Mode’s dedicated-target
(https://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-Links.html#Internal-Links) and
‘:only-contents’ property.

   For dedicated targets, the target paragraph must be identifiable by a
dedicated target with a ‘<<paragraph-id>>’:

     Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
     Suspendisse ac velit fermentum, sodales nunc in,
     tincidunt quam. <<paragraph-id>>

   It is generally assumed that the ‘paragraph-id’ is placed after its
content, but it is not an absolute requirement; it can be in the
beginning (before the content) or in the middle of it.

   For the ‘:only-contents’ property, refer to sub-section *note
Filtering Org elements per transclusion: Filter Org elements per
transclusion.


File: org-transclusion.info,  Node: Control levels of headlines per transclusion,  Next: Filter Org elements per transclusion,  Prev: Org links supported,  Up: Usage

4.3 Control levels of headlines per transclusion
================================================

When you transclude Org contents, you can specify a different headline
level than those of the source Org file.

   Use the ‘:level’ property with a value of single digit number from 1
to 9 like this example below.

     #+transclude: [[file:path/to/file.org::*Headline]] :level 2

   The top level of the transcluded headline will set to the value of
‘:level’ property – in this example, level 2 regardless of that in the
source.  When the headline contains sub-headlines, they will be all
automatically promoted or demoted to align according to how many levels
the top of the subtree will move.

   When you transclude an entire Org file, it may contain multiple
subtrees.  In such cases, the top-most level among the subtrees will be
set according to the ‘:level’ property; the rest of headlines in the
buffer will align accordingly.

   Other ways to control include the following.

‘org-transclusion-make-from-link’
     Make a transclusion keyword from a link at point.  If you pass a
     positive number 1-9 with ‘digit-argument’ (e.g.  prefix ‘M-x’ with
     ‘C-2’ to pass "2"), this function automatically puts the ‘:level’
     property to the resultant transclusion keyword.

‘org-transclusion-promote-subtree’
     Promote transcluded subtree at point.  Mapped to "P" (capital "p")
     by default in ‘org-transclusion-map’

‘org-transclusion-demote-subtree’
     Demote transcluded subtree at point.  Mapped to "D" (capital "D")
     by default in ‘org-transclusion-map’

4.4 Filter Org elements per transclusion
========================================

You can control what elements to include in many different ways with
using various filters.  The filters work in two layers: customizable
variable and properties per transclude keyword.

   The following two customizable variables are applicable to all
transclusions globally.  You can think of them as the global default.

‘org-transclusion-exclude-elements’
     This customizable variable globally defines the exclusion filter
     for elements.  It is a list of symbols; the acceptable values can
     be seen by inspecting ‘org-element-all-elements’.  The default is
     to exclude ‘property-drawer’.

     Refer also to the *note sub-section on this user option:
     Customizable filter to exclude certain Org elements.

‘org-transclusion-include-first-section’
     This customizing variable globally defines whether or not to
     include the first section of the source Org file.  The first
     section is the part before the first headline – that’s the section
     that typically contains ‘#+title’, ‘#+author’, and so on.  Many
     people also write notes in it without adding any headlines.  Note
     that this user option’s default is now ‘t’ (changed from ‘nil’ as
     users seem to spend time to "correct" this issue).  Turn it to ‘t’
     if you wish to transclude the content from the first section of
     your Org files.  If you wish to exclude the "meta data" defined by
     ‘#+title’ and others, exclude ‘keyword’ as described in this
     section – these meta data are defined with using the ‘keyword’
     element of Org Mode.

     Refer also to the *note sub-section on this user option: Include
     the section before the first headline (Org file only).

   In addition to the global user options above, you can fine-tune the
default exclusion filter per transclusion.  Add following properties to
transclusions you wish to apply additional filters.

‘:only-contents’
     This property lets you exclude titles of headlines when you
     transclude a subtree (headline); you transclude only the contents.
     When the subtree contains sub-headlines, all the contents will be
     transcluded.

     Add ‘:only-contents’ without any value like this example:

     #+transclude: [[file:path/to/file.org]] :only-contents

‘:exclude-elements’
     This property lets you *add* elements to exclude per transclusion
     on top of the variable ‘org-transclusion-exclude-elements’ defines.
     You cannot *remove* the ones defined by it; thus, it is intended
     that you use the customizable variable as your global default and
     fine-tune it by the property per transclusion.

     Add ‘:exclude-elements’ with a list of elements (each one as
     defined by ‘org-element-all-elements’) separated by a space inside
     double quotation marks like this example:

     #+transclude: [[file:path/to/file.org]] :exclude-elements "drawer keyword"

   You can combine ‘:only-contents’ and ‘:exclude-elements’ to control
how you transclude a subtree.  With these properties, you can really
have great control over what to include and exclude.  It might be a
little overwhelming at a time but the changes via properties are easy to
change – simply press ‘d’ to remove the transclusion, change the
properties, and transclude again to see a new result.

* Notes on excluding the headline element::


File: org-transclusion.info,  Node: Notes on excluding the headline element,  Up: Filter Org elements per transclusion

4.4.1 Notes on excluding the headline element
---------------------------------------------

If you add ‘headline’ as a list of elements to exclude, you exclude
sub-headlines within your subtrees and you will still transclude the
content of the top-most headline of the subtrees.

   If you are transcluding only one subtree, this should be intuitive.
If you transclude a whole buffer, you might be transcluding multiple
subtrees.  In some cases, this can be a little anti-intuitive.  In the
following examples, you will be transcluding three subtrees – even
though the first headline levels are lower than the third one, the first
two are still the top-most level of their own respective subtrees.

     ** Headline 1
        Content of Headline 1
     ** Headline 2
        Content of Headline 2
     * Headline 3
       Content of Headline

4.5 Live-sync edit
==================

*Experimental.*  You can start live-sync edit by pressing ‘e’ (by
default) on a text element you want to edit.  This will call
‘org-transclusion-live-sync-start’ and put a colored overlay on top of
the region being live-synced and brings up another buffer that visits
the source file of the transclusion.  The source buffer will also have a
corresponding overlay to the region being edited and live-synced.

   If you have other windows open, they will be temporarily hidden –
Org-transclusion will remembers your current window layout and attempts
to recover it when you exit live-sync edit.

   In the live-sync edit region, you can freely type to edit the
transclusion or source regions; they will sync simultaneously.

   Once done with editing, press ‘C-c C-c’ to exit live-sync edit.  The
key is bound to ‘org-transclusion-live-sync-exit’.  It will turn off the
live sync edit but keep the transclusion on.

   In the live-sync edit region, the normal ‘yank’ command (‘C-y’) is
replaced with a special command ‘org-transclusion-live-sync-paste’.
This command lets the pasted text inherit the text-properties of the
transcluded region correctly; the normal yank does not have this feature
and thus causes some inconvenience in live-sync edit.  If you use vim
keybindings (e.g.  ‘evil-mode’), it is advised that you review the
default keybindings.  You can customize the local keybindings for the
live-sync region by ‘org-transclusion-live-sync-map’.

   *Note*: During live-sync edit, file’s content gets saved to the file
system as is – i.e.  the transcluded text will be saved instead of the
‘#+transclude:’ keyword.  If you kill buffer or quit Emacs, other hooks
will still remove the transclusion to keep the file clear of the
transcluded copy, leaving only the keyword in the file system.

4.6 Transclude source file into src-block
=========================================

This feature is provided as an *note extension: Extensions. (default
on).

   You can transclude a source file into an Org’s src block.  Use the
‘:src’ property and specify the language you would like to use like
this:

     #+transclude: [[file:../../test/python-1.py]] :src python

   The content you specify in the link gets wrapped into a src-block
with the language like this:

     #+begin_src python
     [... content of python-1.py]
     #+end_src

   Use ‘:rest’ property to define additional properties you would like
to add for the src-block.  The double quotation marks are mandatory for
the ‘:rest’ property.

     #+transclude: [[file:../../test/python-3.py]]  :src python :rest ":session :results value"

   The source block will have the additional properties:
     #+begin_src python :session :results value

4.7 Transclude range of lines for text and source files
=======================================================

This feature is provided as an *note extension: Extensions. (default

* end property to specify a search term to dynamically look for the end of a range::


File: org-transclusion.info,  Node: lines property to specify a range of lines,  Next: end property to specify a search term to dynamically look for the end of a range,  Up: Transclude range of lines for text and source files

4.7.1 ‘:lines’ property to specify a range of lines
---------------------------------------------------

You can specify a range of lines to transclude from a source and text
file.  Use the ‘:lines’ property like this.

     #+transclude: [[file:../../test/test.txt]] :lines 3-5

   The rage is specified by the number "3-5"; in this case, lines from 3
to 5, both lines inclusive.

   To transclude a single line, have the the same number in both places
(e.g.  10-10, meaning line 10 only).

   One of the numbers can be omitted.  When the first number is omitted
(e.g.  -10), it means from the beginning of the file to line 10.
Likewise, when the second number is omitted (e.g.  10-), it means from
line 10 to the end of file.

   You can combine the ‘:lines’ property with the ‘:src’ property to
transclude only a certain range of source files (Example 1 below).

   For Org’s file links, you can use search options
(https://orgmode.org/manual/Search-Options.html) specified by the "::"
(two colons) notation.  When a search finds a line that includes the
string, the Org-transclude counts it as the starting line 1 for the
‘:lines’ property.

   Example 1: This transcludes the four lines of the source file from
the line that contains string "id-1234" (including that line counted as
line 1).
     #+transclude: [[file:../../test/python-1.py::id-1234]] :lines 1-4 :src python

   Example 2: This transcludes only the single line that contains the
line found by the search option for text string "Transcendental
Ontology"
     #+transclude: [[file:../../test/test.txt::Transcendental Ontology]] :lines 1-1

   Note search-options ‘::/regex/’ and ‘::number’ do not work as
intended.

4.7.2 ‘:end’ property to specify a search term to dynamically look for the end of a range
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can add ‘:end’ property and specify the search term as its value.
Surround the search term with double quotation marks (mandatory).

   See Example 3 below.  This transclusion will look for ‘id-1234’ as
the beginning line of the range as specified by the search option
‘::id-1234’ in the link.  With the ‘:end’ property, the search term
‘id-1234 end here’ defines the end of the range.  The search looks for
‘id-123 end here’ in the body text, and use the line one before the one
where the text is find (thus, the transcluded range will not contain
‘id-1234 end here’).

   You can also combined ‘:lines’ property with ‘:end’ property.  It
will only displace the beginning, and the end part of the range (the
second number after the hyphen "-") is ignored.  In the same example,
the beginning of the range is the one line after the line where
"id-1234" is found; it’s the "second line, or line 2".  Instead of
transcluding until the end of the buffer, the end is defined by the
‘:end’ property.

   Example 3:
     #+transclude: [[file:../../test/python-1.py::id-1234]] :lines 2- :src python :end "id-1234 end here"

4.8 Extensions
==============

Org-transclusion provides a simple extension framework, where you can
use ‘customize’ to selectively add new features.

   If you use ‘customize’, the features are loaded automatically.  Note
that it does not "unload" the feature until you relaunch Emacs.

   If you do not use ‘customize’ (e.g.  Doom), you may need to
explicitly require an extension.  For example, to activate
‘org-transclusion-indent-mode’, you might need to add something like
this in your configuration file.

     ;; Ensure that load-path to org-transclusion is already added
     ;; If you installed it with the built-in package.el, this should be already done.
     ;; (add-to-list  'load-path "path/to/org-transclusion/")
     (add-to-list 'org-transclusion-extensions 'org-transclusion-indent-mode)
     (require 'org-transclusion-indent-mode)

   Currently, the following extensions are available.

(off by default) ‘org-transclusion-indent-mode’
     Support org-indent-mode.

(on by default) ‘org-transclusion-src-lines’
     Add features for ‘:src’ and ‘:lines’ properties to ‘#+transclude’.
     It is meant for non-Org files such as program source and text files

(on by default) ‘org-transclusion-font-lock’
     Add font-lock for ‘#+transclude’.  Org mode’s standard syntax
     treats the combination of a ‘#+transclude:’ keyword and a link used
     by Org-transclusion as a keyword.  This means it applies the
     ‘org-meta-line’ face and the link part cannot be toggled as a
     normal link.  This extension adds ‘org-transclusion-keyword’ face
     to the keyword part and lets the link part to be treated as a
     normal link for ‘org-toggle-link-display’.

5 Customizing
*************

You can customize settings in the ‘org-transclusion’ group.

‘org-transclusion-extensions’
     Defines extensions to be loaded with org-transclusion.el.  If you
     use ‘customize’, the extensions are loaded by it.  If you don’t,
     you likely need to explicitly use ‘require’ to load them.  See
     *note seb-section: Extensions.

‘org-transclusion-add-all-on-activate’
     Defines whether or not all the active transclusions (with ‘t’) get
     automatically transcluded on minor mode activation
     (‘org-transclusion-mode’).  This does not affect the manual
     activation when you directly call ‘org-transclusion-activate’

‘org-transclusion-exclude-elements’
     See *note sub-section: Customizable filter to exclude certain Org
     elements.

‘org-transclusion-include-first-section’
     See *note sub-section: Include the section before the first
     headline (Org file only).

‘org-transclusion-open-source-display-action-list’
     You can customize the way the ‘org-transclusion-open-source’
     function displays the source buffer for the transclusion.  You
     specify the "action" in the way defined by the built-in
     ‘display-buffer’ function.  Refer to its in-system documentation
     (with ‘C-h f’) for the accepted values.  ‘M-x customize’ can also
     guide you on what types of values are accepted.

‘org-transclusion-mode-lighter’
     Define the lighter for Org-transclusion minor mode.  The default is
     " OT".

5.1 Customizable filter to exclude certain Org elements
=======================================================

Set customizable variable ‘org-transclusion-exclude-elements’ to define
which elements to be *excluded* in the transclusion.

   The filter works for all supported types of links within an Org file
when transcluding an entire Org file, and parts of it (headlines, custom
ID, etc.).  There is no filter for non-Org files.

   It is a list of symbols, and the default is ‘(property-drawer)’.  The
accepted values are the ones defined by ‘org-element-all-elements’
(Org’s standard set of elements; refer to its documentation for an
exhaustive list).

   You can also fine-tune the exclusion filter per transclusion.  Refer
to the sub-section on *note filtering Org elements per transclusion:
Filter Org elements per transclusion.

5.2 Include the section before the first headline (Org file only)
=================================================================

You can include the first section (section before the first headline) of
an Org file.  It is toggled via customizable variable
‘org-transclusion-include-first-section’.  Its default value is ‘t’.
Set it to ‘t’ (or non-nil) to transclude the first section.  It also
works when the first section is followed by headlines.

5.3.1 Face for the ‘#+transclude’ keyword
-----------------------------------------

This feature is provided as an *note extension: Extensions. (default
on).

‘org-transclusion-keyword’
     You can set your own face to the ‘#+transclude’ keyword with using
     the ‘org-transclusion-keyword’ face.

5.3.2 Faces for the fringes next to transcluded region and source region
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the fringes that indicate transcluding and source regions are not
visible in your system (e.g.  Doom), try adding background and/or
foreground colors to these custom faces.

   • ‘org-transclusion-source-fringe’
   • ‘org-transclusion-fringe’

   To customize a face, it’s probably the easiest to use ‘M-x
customize-face’.  If you want to use Elisp for some reason (e.g.  on
Doom), something like this below should set faces.  Experiment with the
colors of your choice.  By default, the faces above have no values.

     (set-face-attribute
      'org-transclusion-fringe nil
      :foreground "green"
      :background "green")

   For colors, where "green" is, you can also use something like
"#62c86a" (Emacs calls it "RGB triple"; you can refer to in-system
manual Emacs > Colors).  You might also like to refer to a list of
currently defined faces in your Emacs by ‘list-faces-display’.

   Other faces:
   • ‘org-transclusion-source’
   • ‘org-transclusion-source-edit’
   • ‘org-transclusion’
   • ‘org-transclusion-edit’
   • ‘org-transclusion-fringe-bitmap’ It is used for the fringe that
     indicates the transcluded region.  It works only in a graphical
     environment (not in terminal).

6 Known Limitations
*******************

Note this section is still incomplete, not exhaustive for "known"
limitations.

   • Org link’s search-options ‘::/regex/’ and ‘::number’ do not work as
     intended.

   • ‘org-transclusion-live-sync-start’ does not support all Org
     elements For transclusions of Org elements or buffers, live-sync
     works only on the following elements: ‘center-block’, ‘drawer’,
     ‘dynamic-block’, ‘latex-environment’, ‘paragraph’, ‘plain-list’,
     ‘quote-block’, ‘special-block’, ‘table’, and ‘verse-block’.

     It is known that live-sync does not work for the other elements;
     namely: ‘comment-block’, ‘export-block’, ‘example-block’,
     ‘fixed-width’, ‘keyword’, ‘src-block’, and ‘property-drawer’.

     More technical reason for this limitation is documented in the
     docstring of function
     ‘org-transclusion-live-sync-enclosing-element’.

     Work is in progress to lift this limitation but I’m still
     experimenting different ideas.

   • ‘org-indent-mode’ may not work well with Org-transclusion A new
     extension has been added to support ‘org-indent-mode’ Refer to
     *note this section: Extensions.

   • Doom’s customization may interfere with Org-transclusion Refer to
     issue #52 (https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion/issues/52).
     The symptom is that in Doom you get an error message that includes
     this: "progn: ‘recenter’ing a window that does not display
     current-buffer."  Adding this in your configuration has been
     reported to fix the issue:

     ‘(advice-remove 'org-link-search
     '+org--recenter-after-follow-link-a)’

     It is probably rather drastic a measure.  I will appreciate it if
     you find a less drastic way that works.  Thank you.

   • Org refile does not work "properly" on the transcluded headlines
     Refer to issue #20
     (https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion/issues/20).  I don’t
     intend to support this – refile the source, not the transcluded
     copy.

   • Org-transclusion does not support expansion of noweb references
     when a transcluded source block code has them Refer to issue #86
     (https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion/issues/86).  You will
     get "Text read-only" error when export tries to expand the noweb
     references into the source code.  †noweb reference

7.1 Original idea by John Kitchin
=================================

<https://github.com/alphapapa/transclusion-in-emacs#org-mode>

     {O} transcluding some org-elements in multiple places _[2016-12-09
     ven.]  _ John Kitchin asks:

     I have an idea for how I could transclude “copies” or links to
     org-elements in multiple places and keep them up to date.  A
     prototypical example of this is I have a set of org-contacts in one
     place, and I want to create a new list of people for a committee in
     a new place made of “copies” of the contact headlines.  But I do
     not really want to duplicate the headlines, and if I modify one, I
     want it reflected in the other places.  I do not want just links to
     those contacts, because then I can not do things with
     org-map-entries, and other org-machinery which needs the actual
     headlines/properties present.  Another example might be I want a
     table in two places, but the contents of them should stay
     synchronized, ditto for a code block.

     This idea was inspired by
     <https://github.com/gregdetre/emacs-freex>.

     The idea starts with creating (wait for it…) a new link ;) In a
     document where I want to transclude a headline, I would enter
     something like:

     transclude:some-file.org::*headline title

     Then, I would rely on the font-lock system to replace that link
     with the headline and its contents (via the :activate-func link
     property), and to put an overlay on it with a bunch of useful
     properties, including modification hooks that would update the
     source if I change the the element in this document, and some
     visual indication that it is transcluded (e.g.  light gray
     background/tooltip).

     I would create a kill-buffer hook function that would replace that
     transcluded content with the original link.  A focus-in hook
     function would make sure the transcluded content is updated when
     you enter the frame.  So when the file is not open, there is just a
     transclude link indicating what should be put there, and when it is
     open, the overlay modification hooks and focus hook should ensure
     everything stays synchronized (as long as external processes are
     not modifying the contents).

     It seems like this could work well for headlines, and named tables,
     src blocks, and probably any other element that can be addressed by
     a name/ID.

7.2 Text-Clone
==============

‘text-clone.el’ is an extension of text-clone functions written as part
of GNU Emacs in ‘subr.el’.  The first adaption to extend text-clone
functions to work across buffers was published in StackExchange by the
user named Tobias in March 2020.  It can be found at
<https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/56201/is-there-an-emacs-package-which-can-mirror-a-region/56202#56202>.
The text-clone library takes this line of work further.

*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
