@noindent

This manual is for Org-transclusion version 1.0.x.

last updated 23 December 2021.

Org-transclusion lets you insert a copy of text content via a file link or ID link within an Org file. It lets you have the same content present in different buffers at the same time without copy-and-pasting it. Edit the source of the content, and you can refresh the transcluded copies to the up-to-date state. Org-transclusion keeps your files clear of the transcluded copies, leaving only the links to the original content.

@node Example Use Cases & Main Features
@chapter Example Use Cases & Main Features

Example Use Cases:

@table @asis
@item Book writing
You have a collection of notes. You can quickly transclude paragraphs and sections from them into a draft. As they are links, it's easy to re-organize them into different sequences to see which way works the best. 

@item Academic writing
You have a collection of quotes and notes from your research and literature review. Transclude relevant elements of quotes and notes into different papers. You can keep your collection as the central repository of your research.

@item Technical writing
You write technical documents for software. Transclude relevant lines of code into the document. As the code is only transcluded. You can keep the document up-to-date as the code evolves.

@item Project status reports
You work on multiple projects at the same time and need to report to different project managers. Transclude relevant parts of your work notes and logs into respective project reports. You can keep a single collection of your work notes and logs.
@end table

Main Features:

@itemize
@item
Insert a copy of text content via a file link or ID link into an Org file

@item
Work with any text file such as program source cod, plain text, Markdown, or other Org files

@item
Keep the file system clear of the copies of text content -- Org-transclusion tries hard to save only the links to the file system

@item
For Org files, use different headline levels from the source Org file

@item
For Org files, use filters to include only relevant elements (e.g. filter out properties in the transclusions)

@item
For program source and plain text files, transclude a certain lines or dynamically specify the from/to lines to keep the transclusion always up-to-date with the evolving source files

@item
For program source files, transclude parts or whole code directly into Org's source block to leverage the rich Org features

@item
Extend Org-transclusion with its extension framework

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

This package is available on @uref{https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/org-transclusion.html, GNU ELPA}. You can do @samp{M-x package-install RET
org-transclusion} to install it.  After installation, you can start using
Org-transclusion (refer to the @ref{Getting Started} section).  You can define
keybindings in your configuration like this below.

@lisp
(define-key global-map (kbd "<f12>") #'org-transclusion-add)
(define-key global-map (kbd "C-n t") #'org-transclusion-mode)
@end lisp

If you use Doom, you can do something like this below to install the package.  Then add @samp{use-package!} to load the package in your @samp{config.el} like an example below.

@lisp
;; ~/.doom.d/package.el
(package! org-transclusion)
@end lisp


@lisp
;; ~/.doom.d/config.el
(use-package! org-transclusion
  :after org
  :init
  (map!
   :map global-map "<f12>" #'org-transclusion-add
   :leader
   :prefix "n"
   :desc "Org Transclusion Mode" "t" #'org-transclusion-mode))
@end lisp

@node Getting Started
@chapter Getting Started

@findex org-transclusion-add
@findex org-transclusion-add-all
@findex org-transclusion-make-from-link
@findex org-transclusion-open-source
@findex org-transclusion-move-to-source
@findex org-transclusion-refresh
@vindex org-transclusion-map

The basic idea of Org-transclusion is simple: insert a copy of text content via a file link or ID link within an Org file. This is an Org Mode version of transclusion.

To transclude content via a link, use one of the following commands:

@itemize
@item
@samp{org-transclusion-add}

@item
@samp{org-transclusion-add-all}

@item
@samp{org-transclusion-make-from-link}
@end itemize

For example, if you have an ID link in your Org file like this:

@example
[[id:20210501T171427.051019][Bertrand Russell]]
@end example

Simply type to add @samp{#+transclude:} in front of the link like the example below.

@example
#+transclude: [[id:20210501T171427.051019][Bertrand Russell]]
@end example

Put your cursor somewhere on this keyword line and type @samp{M-x org-transclusion-add RET}, and you will see the text content that the ID points replace the whole line. If you have multiple links with a transclude keyword, you can type @samp{M-x org-transclusion-add-all RET} to do all transclusions in the current buffer.

Alternatively, you can also put cursor somewhere on the link and call  @samp{M-x org-transclusion-make-from-link}. That will insert another line with @samp{#+transclusion:} keyword appended in front of a copy of the original link in the next empty line.

The transcluded text is @strong{read-only} but you can copy it and export it as normal text. Org-transclusion remembers where it has transcluded the text from (its source buffer).  You can call a number of useful commands with a single letter (by default).

For example, you can press @samp{o} to open the source buffer of the transclusion at point, or @samp{O} (capital "o") to open and move to it. Press @samp{g} to refresh the transclusion. Press @samp{e} to start live-sync edit. For more detail, inspect the documentation of each command. Press @samp{d} to remove the transcluded content, putting the original @samp{#+transclude: [[id:id-of-the-content]]}.

This single-letter-context-menu is defined in @samp{org-transclusion-map}. The default keybindings are shown below. Adapt them to your liking, especially if you use vim keybindings with Evil Mode, etc.

@example
key             binding
---             -------

C-c             Prefix Command
TAB             org-cycle
D               org-transclusion-demote-subtree
O               org-transclusion-move-to-source
P               org-transclusion-promote-subtree
d               org-transclusion-remove
e               org-transclusion-live-sync-start
g               org-transclusion-refresh
o               org-transclusion-open-source

C-c C-c         org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c

@end example

This should get you started with Org-transclusion. There are more options and customizing options available for you to fine-tune the text content you transclude. Explore the rest of the user manual and play with Org-transclusion to get familiar with it.

@cindex Transclusion Properties
@cindex Property - :disable-auto
@vindex org-transclusion-add-all-on-activate

Org-transclusion is a local minor mode; however, you do not need to explicitly call @samp{org-transclusion-mode}. The minor mode is intended to be just a convenient wrapper to let you easily toggle between @samp{activate} and @samp{deactivate}.

As you saw in the @ref{Getting Started, , Getting Started section} above, calling @samp{org-transclusion-add} or @samp{org-transclusion-add-all} is enough to add transclusions in your current buffer.

The minor mode is automatically turned on locally for your current buffer through one of these commands. All it does is to call @samp{org-transclusion-activate}  to activate hooks and some other variables. Their main purpose is to keep files in the filesystem clear of the transcluded content.

Turn off the minor mode or use @samp{org-transclusion-deactivate}; you will remove all the transclusions in the current buffer and clear the hooks and other setup variables.

If you prefer, you can use @samp{org-transclusion-mode} as your entry command for transclusion. When customizable variable @samp{org-transclusion-add-all-on-activate} is non-nil (it is @samp{t} by default), turning on the minor mode calls the @samp{org-transclusion-add-all} command to attempt to add all transclusions automatically in the current buffer.

You can control whether or not transclusions are to be added automatically per transclude keyword. By default, @samp{org-transclusion-add-all} (it is also used by @samp{org-transclusion-mode}) will work on every transclude keyword in the buffer. Add @samp{:disable-auto} property to a keyword as shown in the example below; @samp{add-all} skips transclude keywords with it.

@example
#+transclude: [[file:path/to/file.org]] :disable-auto
@end example

You can override the @samp{:disable-auto} property by manually calling @samp{org-transclusion-add} at point.

@node Org links supported
@section Org links supported

@cindex Org Links Supported
@cindex Property - :only-contents

Transclusion has been tested to work for the following types of links:

@itemize
@item
File link for an entire org file/buffer; e.g. @samp{[[file:~/org/file.org][My Org Notes]]}
@item
File link with @samp{::*heading}
@item
File link with @samp{::#custom-id}
@item
File link with @samp{::name} for blocks (e.g. blocked quotations), tables, and links
@item
File link with @samp{::dedicated-target}; this is intended for linking to a paragraph. See below.
@item
ID link @samp{id:uuid}
@item
File link for non-org files (tested with @samp{.txt} and @samp{.md}); for these, the whole buffer gets transcluded
@end itemize

Note search-options @samp{::/regex/} and @samp{::number} do not work as intended.

For transcluding a specific paragraph, there are two main ways: Org Mode's @uref{https://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-Links.html#Internal-Links, dedicated-target} and @samp{:only-contents} property.

For dedicated targets, the target paragraph must be identifiable by a dedicated target with a @samp{<<paragraph-id>>}:

@example
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Suspendisse ac velit fermentum, sodales nunc in,
tincidunt quam. <<paragraph-id>>
@end example

It is generally assumed that the @samp{paragraph-id} is placed after its content, but it is not an absolute requirement; it can be in the beginning (before the content) or in the middle of it.

For the @samp{:only-contents} property, refer to sub-section @ref{Filter Org elements per transclusion, , Filtering Org elements per transclusion}.

@node Control levels of headlines per transclusion
@section Control levels of headlines per transclusion

@cindex Property - :level
@findex org-transclusion-demote-subtree
@findex org-transclusion-promote-subtree
@findex org-transclusion-make-from-link

When you transclude Org contents, you can specify a different headline level than those of the source Org file.

Use the @samp{:level} property with a value of single digit number from 1 to 9 like this example below.

@example
#+transclude: [[file:path/to/file.org::*Headline]] :level 2
@end example

The top level of the transcluded headline will set to the value of @samp{:level} property -- in this example, level 2 regardless of that in the source. When the headline contains sub-headlines, they will be all automatically promoted or demoted to align according to how many levels the top of the subtree will move.

When you transclude an entire Org file, it may contain multiple subtrees. In such cases, the top-most level among the subtrees will be set according to the @samp{:level} property; the rest of headlines in the buffer will align accordingly.

Other ways to control include the following.

@table @asis
@item @samp{org-transclusion-make-from-link}
Make a transclusion keyword from a link at point. If you pass a positive number 1-9 with @samp{digit-argument} (e.g. prefix @samp{M-x} with @samp{C-2} to pass "2"), this function automatically puts the @samp{:level} property to the resultant transclusion keyword.

@item @samp{org-transclusion-promote-subtree}
Promote transcluded subtree at point. Mapped to "P" (capital "p") by default in @samp{org-transclusion-map}

@item @samp{org-transclusion-demote-subtree}
Demote transcluded subtree at point. Mapped to "D" (capital "D") by default in @samp{org-transclusion-map}
@end table

@node Filter Org elements per transclusion
@section Filter Org elements per transclusion

@cindex Filters
@vindex org-transclusion-exclude-elements
@vindex org-transclusion-include-first-section
@cindex Property - :only-content

You can control what elements to include in many different ways with using various filters. The filters work in two layers: customizable variable and properties per transclude keyword.

The following two customizable variables are applicable to all transclusions globally. You can think of them as the global default.

@table @asis
@item @samp{org-transclusion-exclude-elements}
This customizable variable globally defines the exclusion filter for elements. It is a list of symbols; the acceptable values can be seen by inspecting @samp{org-element-all-elements}. The default is to exclude @samp{property-drawer}.

Refer also to the @ref{Customizable filter to exclude certain Org elements, , sub-section on this user option}.

@item @samp{org-transclusion-include-first-section}
This customizing variable globally defines whether or not to include the first section of the source Org file. The first section is the part before the first headline -- that's the section that typically contains @samp{#+title}, @samp{#+author}, and so on. Many people also write notes in it without adding any headlines. Note that this user option's default is now @samp{t} (changed from @samp{nil} as users seem to spend time to "correct" this issue). Turn it to @samp{t} if you wish to transclude the content from the first section of your Org files. If you wish to exclude the "meta data" defined by @samp{#+title} and others, exclude @samp{keyword} as described in this section -- these meta data are defined with using the @samp{keyword} element of Org Mode.

Refer also to the @ref{Include the section before the first headline (Org file only), , sub-section on this user option}.
@end table

In addition to the global user options above, you can fine-tune the default exclusion filter per transclusion. Add following properties to transclusions you wish to apply additional filters.

@table @asis
@item @samp{:only-contents}
This property lets you exclude titles of headlines when you transclude a subtree (headline); you transclude only the contents. When the subtree contains sub-headlines, all the contents will be transcluded.

Add @samp{:only-contents} without any value like this example:
@end table

@example
#+transclude: [[file:path/to/file.org]] :only-contents
@end example

@table @asis
@item @samp{:exclude-elements}
This property lets you @strong{add} elements to exclude per transclusion on top of the variable @samp{org-transclusion-exclude-elements} defines. You cannot @strong{remove} the ones defined by it; thus, it is intended that you use the customizable variable as your global default and fine-tune it by the property per transclusion.

Add @samp{:exclude-elements} with a list of elements (each one as defined by @samp{org-element-all-elements}) separated by a space inside double quotation marks like this example:
@end table

@example
#+transclude: [[file:path/to/file.org]] :exclude-elements "drawer keyword"
@end example

You can combine @samp{:only-contents} and @samp{:exclude-elements} to control how you transclude a subtree. With these properties, you can really have great control over what to include and exclude. It might be a little overwhelming at a time but the changes via properties are easy to change -- simply press @samp{d} to remove the transclusion, change the properties, and transclude again to see a new result.

@menu
* Notes on excluding the headline element::
@end menu

@node Notes on excluding the headline element
@subsection Notes on excluding the headline element

If you add @samp{headline} as a list of elements to exclude, you exclude sub-headlines within your subtrees and you will still transclude the content of the top-most headline of the subtrees.

If you are transcluding only one subtree, this should be intuitive. If you transclude a whole buffer, you might be transcluding multiple subtrees. In some cases, this can be a little anti-intuitive. In the following examples, you will be transcluding three subtrees -- even though the first headline levels are lower than the third one, the first two are still the top-most level of their own respective subtrees.

@example
** Headline 1
   Content of Headline 1
** Headline 2
   Content of Headline 2
* Headline 3
  Content of Headline
@end example

@node Live-sync edit
@section Live-sync edit

@cindex Live-sync edit
@findex org-transclusion-live-sync-start
@findex org-transclusion-live-sync-exit
@findex org-transclusion-live-sync-paste
@vindex org-transclusion-live-sync-map

@strong{Experimental.} You can start live-sync edit by pressing @samp{e} (by default) on a text element you want to edit. This will call @samp{org-transclusion-live-sync-start} and put a colored overlay on top of the region being live-synced and brings up another buffer that visits the source file of the transclusion. The source buffer will also have a corresponding overlay to the region being edited and live-synced.

If you have other windows open, they will be temporarily hidden -- Org-transclusion will remembers your current window layout and attempts to recover it when you exit live-sync edit.

In the live-sync edit region, you can freely type to edit the transclusion or source regions; they will sync simultaneously.

Once done with editing, press @samp{C-c C-c} to exit live-sync edit. The key is bound to @samp{org-transclusion-live-sync-exit}. It will turn off the live sync edit but keep the transclusion on.

In the live-sync edit region, the normal @samp{yank} command (@samp{C-y}) is replaced with a special command @samp{org-transclusion-live-sync-paste}. This command lets the pasted text inherit the text-properties of the transcluded region correctly; the normal yank does not have this feature and thus causes some inconvenience in live-sync edit. If you use vim keybindings (e.g. @samp{evil-mode}), it is advised that you review the default keybindings. You can customize the local keybindings for the live-sync region by @samp{org-transclusion-live-sync-map}.

@strong{Note}: During live-sync edit, file's content gets saved to the file system as is -- i.e. the transcluded text will be saved instead of the @samp{#+transclude:} keyword. If you kill buffer or quit Emacs, other hooks will still remove the transclusion to keep the file clear of the transcluded copy, leaving only the keyword in the file system.

@node Transclude source file into src-block
@section Transclude source file into src-block

@cindex Transclude into Org's src-block
@cindex Property - :src
@cindex Property - :rest

This feature is provided as an @ref{Extensions, , extension} (default on). 

You can transclude a source file into an Org's src block. Use the @samp{:src} property and specify the language you would like to use like this:

@example
#+transclude: [[file:../../test/python-1.py]] :src python
@end example

The content you specify in the link gets wrapped into a src-block with the language like this:

@example
#+begin_src python
[... content of python-1.py]
#+end_src
@end example

Use @samp{:rest} property to define additional properties you would like to add for the src-block. The double quotation marks are mandatory for the @samp{:rest} property.

@example
#+transclude: [[file:../../test/python-3.py]]  :src python :rest ":session :results value"
@end example

The source block will have the additional properties:
@example
#+begin_src python :session :results value
@end example

@node Transclude range of lines for text and source files
@section Transclude range of lines for text and source files

@cindex Transclude range of lines

This feature is provided as an @ref{Extensions, , extension} (default on). 

When you transclude text files other than Org files, 

@menu
* @samp{lines} property to specify a range of lines::
* @samp{end} property to specify a search term to dynamically look for the end of a range::
@end menu

@node @samp{lines} property to specify a range of lines
@subsection @samp{:lines} property to specify a range of lines

@cindex Property - :lines

You can specify a range of lines to transclude from a source and text file. Use the @samp{:lines} property like this.

@example
#+transclude: [[file:../../test/test.txt]] :lines 3-5
@end example

The rage is specified by the number "3-5"; in this case, lines from 3 to 5, both lines inclusive.

To transclude a single line, have the the same number in both places (e.g. 10-10, meaning line 10 only).

One of the numbers can be omitted.  When the first number is omitted (e.g. -10), it means from the beginning of the file to line 10. Likewise, when the second number is omitted (e.g. 10-), it means from line 10 to the end of file.

You can combine the @samp{:lines} property with the @samp{:src} property to transclude only a certain range of source files (Example 1 below).

For Org's file links, you can use @uref{https://orgmode.org/manual/Search-Options.html, search options} specified by the "::" (two colons) notation. When a search finds a line that includes the string, the Org-transclude counts it as the starting line 1 for the  @samp{:lines} property.

Example 1: This transcludes the four lines of the source file from the line that contains string "id-1234" (including that line counted as line 1).
@example
#+transclude: [[file:../../test/python-1.py::id-1234]] :lines 1-4 :src python
@end example

Example 2: This transcludes only the single line that contains the line found by the search option for text string "Transcendental Ontology"
@example
#+transclude: [[file:../../test/test.txt::Transcendental Ontology]] :lines 1-1
@end example

Note search-options @samp{::/regex/} and @samp{::number} do not work as intended.

@node @samp{end} property to specify a search term to dynamically look for the end of a range
@subsection @samp{:end} property to specify a search term to dynamically look for the end of a range

@cindex Property - :end

You can add @samp{:end} property and specify the search term as its value. Surround the search term with double quotation marks (mandatory).

See Example 3 below. This transclusion will look for @samp{id-1234} as the beginning line of the range as specified by the search option @samp{::id-1234} in the link. With the @samp{:end} property, the search term @samp{id-1234 end here} defines the end of the range. The search looks for @samp{id-123 end here} in the body text, and use the line one before the one where the text is find (thus, the transcluded range will not contain @samp{id-1234 end here}).

You can also combined @samp{:lines} property with @samp{:end} property.  It will only displace the beginning, and the end part of the range (the second number after the hyphen "-")  is ignored. In the same example, the beginning of the range is the one line after the line where "id-1234" is found; it's the "second line, or line 2".  Instead of transcluding until the end of the buffer, the end is defined by the @samp{:end} property.

Example 3:
@example
#+transclude: [[file:../../test/python-1.py::id-1234]] :lines 2- :src python :end "id-1234 end here"

Org-transclusion provides a simple extension framework, where you can use @samp{customize} to selectively add new features. 

If you use @samp{customize}, the features are loaded automatically. Note that it does not "unload" the feature until you relaunch Emacs.

If you do not use @samp{customize} (e.g. Doom), you may need to explicitly require an extension. For example, to activate @samp{org-transclusion-indent-mode}, you might need to add something like this in your configuration file.

@lisp
;; Ensure that load-path to org-transclusion is already added
;; If you installed it with the built-in package.el, this should be already done.
;; (add-to-list  'load-path "path/to/org-transclusion/")
(add-to-list 'org-transclusion-extensions 'org-transclusion-indent-mode)
(require 'org-transclusion-indent-mode)
@end lisp

Currently, the following extensions are available.

@table @asis
@item (off by default) @samp{org-transclusion-indent-mode}
Support org-indent-mode.

@item (on by default) @samp{org-transclusion-src-lines}
Add features for @samp{:src} and @samp{:lines} properties to @samp{#+transclude}. It is meant for non-Org files such as program source and text files

@item (on by default) @samp{org-transclusion-font-lock}
Add font-lock for @samp{#+transclude}. Org mode's standard syntax treats the combination of a @samp{#+transclude:} keyword and a link used by Org-transclusion as a keyword. This means it applies the @samp{org-meta-line} face and the link part cannot be toggled as a normal link. This extension adds @samp{org-transclusion-keyword} face to the keyword part and lets the link part to be treated as a normal link for @samp{org-toggle-link-display}.

The filter works for all supported types of links within an Org file when transcluding an entire Org file, and parts of it (headlines, custom ID, etc.). There is no filter for non-Org files.

It is a list of symbols, and the default is @samp{(property-drawer)}. The accepted values are the ones defined by @samp{org-element-all-elements} (Org's standard set of elements; refer to its documentation for an exhaustive list).

You can also fine-tune the exclusion filter per transclusion. Refer to the sub-section on @ref{Filter Org elements per transclusion, , filtering Org elements per transclusion}.

To customize a face, it's probably the easiest to use @samp{M-x customize-face}. If you want to use Elisp for some reason (e.g. on Doom), something like this below should set faces. Experiment with the colors of your choice. By default, the faces above have no values.

 :foreground "green"
 :background "green")

For colors, where "green" is,  you can also use something like "#62c86a" (Emacs calls it "RGB triple"; you can refer to in-system manual Emacs > Colors). You might also like to refer to a list of currently defined faces in your Emacs by @samp{list-faces-display}.

@node Known Limitations
@chapter Known Limitations

Note this section is still incomplete, not exhaustive for "known" limitations.

@itemize
@item
Org link's search-options @samp{::/regex/} and @samp{::number} do not work as intended.

@item @samp{org-transclusion-live-sync-start} does not support all Org elements
For transclusions of Org elements or buffers, live-sync works only on the following elements:
@samp{center-block}, @samp{drawer}, @samp{dynamic-block}, @samp{latex-environment}, @samp{paragraph}, @samp{plain-list}, @samp{quote-block}, @samp{special-block}, @samp{table}, and @samp{verse-block}.

It is known that live-sync does not work for the other elements; namely:
@samp{comment-block}, @samp{export-block}, @samp{example-block}, @samp{fixed-width}, @samp{keyword}, @samp{src-block}, and @samp{property-drawer}.

More technical reason for this limitation is documented in the docstring of function @samp{org-transclusion-live-sync-enclosing-element}.

Work is in progress to lift this limitation but I'm still experimenting different ideas.

@item @samp{org-indent-mode} may not work well with Org-transclusion
A new extension has been added to support @samp{org-indent-mode}
Refer to @ref{Extensions, , this section}.

@item Doom's customization may interfere with Org-transclusion
Refer to issue @uref{https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion/issues/52, #52}. The symptom is that in Doom you get an error message that includes this: "progn: ‘recenter’ing a window that does not display current-buffer." Adding this in your configuration has been reported to fix the issue:

@samp{(advice-remove 'org-link-search '+org--recenter-after-follow-link-a)}

It is probably rather drastic a measure. I will appreciate it if you find a less drastic way that works. Thank you.

@item Org refile does not work "properly" on the transcluded headlines
Refer to issue @uref{https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion/issues/20, #20}. I don't intend to support this -- refile the source, not the transcluded copy.

@item Org-transclusion does not support expansion of noweb references when a transcluded source block code has them
Refer to issue @uref{https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion/issues/86, #86}. You will get "Text read-only" error when export tries to expand the noweb references into the source code. †@uref{https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html, noweb reference}

@quotation
@{O@} transcluding some org-elements in multiple places
@emph{[2016-12-09 ven.] } John Kitchin asks:

I have an idea for how I could transclude “copies” or links to org-elements in multiple places and keep them up to date. A prototypical example of this is I have a set of org-contacts in one place, and I want to create a new list of people for a committee in a new place made of “copies” of the contact headlines. But I do not really want to duplicate the headlines, and if I modify one, I want it reflected in the other places. I do not want just links to those contacts, because then I can not do things with org-map-entries, and other org-machinery which needs the actual headlines/properties present. Another example might be I want a table in two places, but the contents of them should stay synchronized, ditto for a code block.

This idea was inspired by @uref{https://github.com/gregdetre/emacs-freex}.

The idea starts with creating (wait for it…) a new link ;) In a document where I want to transclude a headline, I would enter something like:

transclude:some-file.org::*headline title

Then, I would rely on the font-lock system to replace that link with the headline and its contents (via the :activate-func link property), and to put an overlay on it with a bunch of useful properties, including modification hooks that would update the source if I change the the element in this document, and some visual indication that it is transcluded (e.g. light gray background/tooltip).

I would create a kill-buffer hook function that would replace that transcluded content with the original link. A focus-in hook function would make sure the transcluded content is updated when you enter the frame. So when the file is not open, there is just a transclude link indicating what should be put there, and when it is open, the overlay modification hooks and focus hook should ensure everything stays synchronized (as long as external processes are not modifying the contents).

It seems like this could work well for headlines, and named tables, src blocks, and probably any other element that can be addressed by a name/ID@.

@node Text-Clone
@section Text-Clone

@samp{text-clone.el} is an extension of text-clone functions written as part of GNU Emacs in @samp{subr.el}.  The first adaption to extend text-clone functions to work across buffers was published in StackExchange by the user named Tobias in March 2020. It can be found at @uref{https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/56201/is-there-an-emacs-package-which-can-mirror-a-region/56202#56202}. The text-clone library takes this line of work further.
